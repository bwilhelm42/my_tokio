# my_tokio

Taking a deep dive into Futures and their poll() function to understand how they are actually executed. Will also be implementing a thread pool to run the spawned tasks asynchronously.

my_tokio will have two implemented methods: spawn(), to queue a task and run(), to attempt to execute all spawned tasks
